  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
    </li>
    <li><span class="inl">CSS is not neccesary</span> <span class="yellow">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <li><span class="unl">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in # ways:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribure inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>external - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common wat to add CSS, is to keet the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

  <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

  <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are CLASS and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
